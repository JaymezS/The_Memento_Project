# MarsLite

A collection of Mars related applications (mostly built with NASA Open APIs)

- Features:
  - Rover Images from: "Opportunity", "Curiosity", "Spirit", and "Perseverance" Rovers
    - Due to undermaintained API, images from the "Opportunity" and "Spirit" rovers are not availble at this moment
    - Browse By Date, Camera, and Rover
    - (U get to see mars from a different perspective what more do u want lol)

- Features To Come:
  - Mars Weather App
    - Again: More NASA APIs, less work for me
    - ML to predict the weather based on past trends (if possible)
